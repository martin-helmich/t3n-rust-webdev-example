# Web Development with Rust example

This repository contains a minimal example on how to develop various kinds of web applications (JSON APIs and with server-generated HTML) with Rust and the Actix Framework.

These code examples complement my recent article on the topic in the [T3N Magazine](https://t3n.de/magazin/).

## Getting started

Running the example requires [Rust][rust-install] (no shit, Sherlock üïµÔ∏è). Start everything with:

```
$ cargo run
```

[rust-install]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
